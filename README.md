# PuzzlesProject
This project is an interactive program that accepts an image as input and generates a jigsaw puzzle from it.
Additionally, the program randomly shuffles the puzzle pieces and ultimately solves the puzzle automatically without any reference to the original image.
Feel free to upload your own image and give it a try :)
